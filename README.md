# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I used machine learning to analyze credit card risk in a dataset. In order to complete this project, I had to take the following steps: 

1. Import the "imbalance-learn" and "scikit-learn" libraries
2. Oversample the data using the "RandomOverSampler" and "SMOTE" alogrithms
3. Undersample the data using the "ClusterCentroids" algorithm
4. Use a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the "SMOTEENN" algorithm
5. Compare two new models that reduce bias: "BalancedRandomForestClassifier" and "EasyEnsembleClassifier", to predict credit    risk
6. Evaluate the performance of the models and determine whether they should be used to predict credit risk
